# Various ways to restart pods

## Restart deployment
The most gracefull way is to trigger a restart for the deployment.
In this case, a pod will only be terminated once the new pod is ready.
It will slowly replace all pods one after the other.

    kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>

## Restart pods in a statefulset
This is similar to restarting a deployment but for stateful sets:

    kubectl rollout restart statefulset <statefulset-name>

## Hard / Forcefully restart a pod
Since pods are defined in a deployment, if one pod crashes or is killed, 
the deployment will automatically reschedule a new pod.

The effect is, that the pod will be sent to termination first and only then
the new instance will be scheduled.
This will lead to a gap where this instance is missing.

    kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
